# Asocial Exploration for reward foraging using the Robotarium
A minimal python code for the Robotarium (GATech) that allows reproduceable results for multi-agent robot foraging

## How to run the python file
To download the requisite files such that a python based simulation can run on your system, please head to Robotarium's Github repo at
https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator

To submit a job in order to run the simulation based experiment on real robots, head to 
https://robotarium.gatech.edu
NOTE: Anyone can run as many jobs (within reason) as they are free of cost.

Submit the same py file as found in this repository to reproduce a minimalist version used to collect some data for the paper:
"Engineering Social Learning Mechanisms in Multi Agent Robots"
